My dotfiles.

Setup is pretty simple. Drop this folder somewhere (make sure it's in a folder;
you can probably get away with unloading all this stuff in `/home` but that'd
just be ugly...) and run

```
./install.sh
```

Afterwards, to get intellisense, you just need to setup and install ccls.

# TODO
1. Add ctags installation
2. Add autoformat
3. ALE next/prev map
